# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Spring Boot

Spring Boot is one of the most popular frameworks in the Java ecosystem. It helps developers create production-ready applications with minimal effort by providing sensible defaults, auto-configuration, and an embedded server. In this guide, we will go step by step from installation to deployment.

***

## Why Spring Boot?

Traditional Spring applications required a lot of manual XML configuration. Spring Boot removes most of that burden by:

* **Auto-configuration**: Configures beans and settings automatically based on dependencies.
* **Embedded server**: No need to deploy a WAR file to Tomcat manually; it ships with embedded Tomcat by default.
* **Opinionated defaults**: Comes with conventions that reduce boilerplate.
* **Production-ready tools**: Metrics, health checks, environment management.

***

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

* Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher recommended).
* A build tool: **Maven** or **Gradle**.
* An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
* Basic knowledge of Java and REST APIs.

Check your setup:

```bash
java -version
mvn -v
```
